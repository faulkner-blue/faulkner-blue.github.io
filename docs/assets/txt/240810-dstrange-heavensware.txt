D. Strange took up residence at a modest corner of the Heavensware altar, which sprawled and flickered like a Blade Runner miniature. [he started with a simple pad, builds it out] His set mirrored his minimal rig, using little more than 5 samples at a time. Despite this, he rendered a towering atmosphere: supported by dark chords and carefully constructed phrases that still innovated on this traditional idiom. 

[Pedaling home thru the limelight, i had a thought] one can guess as to why he opted for a small rig, maybe it had something to do with the anemic attendance. Still, seeing this tenured Tresor artist is not dissimilar to a [Mozart piano concerto/virtuosic performance/pavorotti type performance]. It makes me whether he considers this as a laboratory for his live set, or if he's phoning it in. [notes on the empirical nature of the set with his stops/starts, default patches but..]

Either way, I had an amazing, transportive experience. I truly believe the 'live electronic set' is undervalued in music discourse. At best, it blurs the lines of composition, improvisation, and curation.
